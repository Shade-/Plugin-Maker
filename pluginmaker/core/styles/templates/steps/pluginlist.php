<div class="box">
Your saved plugins will be displayed here. Hint: clicking on one of them will let you edit it. This feature has been created using the same templates used into the creation of the plugins, so it has yet to be tested intensively. I don't know if it works or whatever damage it may cause. Use carefully.
